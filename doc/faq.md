## Installation & Setup

### What are the system requirements?

**Minimum:**

- 2GB RAM
- 2 CPU cores
- 10GB disk space
- Docker 20.10+
- Docker Compose v2.0+

**Recommended:**

- 4GB+ RAM (more for multiple servers)
- 4+ CPU cores
- 50GB+ SSD storage
- Docker 24.0+

### Can I run Minepanel on Windows?

Yes! Use **Windows with WSL2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux):

1. Install WSL2
2. Install Docker Desktop for Windows
3. Enable WSL2 integration in Docker Desktop
4. Run Minepanel inside WSL2 (Ubuntu)

::: tip
Use WSL2's native filesystem for better performance: `/home/username/minepanel`
:::

### Can I run it on a Raspberry Pi?

Yes! Minepanel supports ARM64 architecture. It works on:

- Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB+ RAM recommended)
- Raspberry Pi 5
- Other ARM-based devices

Docker automatically pulls the correct ARM image.

### Does it work on macOS?

Yes! Minepanel works on both Intel and Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) Macs. Just install Docker Desktop for Mac and follow the standard installation.

### Do I need to know Docker?

No! Minepanel handles all Docker operations for you. However, basic Docker knowledge can help with troubleshooting.

### How do I update Minepanel?

```bash
# Pull latest image
docker pull ketbom/minepanel:latest

# Recreate container
docker compose up -d

# Clean old images
docker image prune
```

Your server data is preserved during updates.

## Security

### How secure is Minepanel?

Minepanel implements several security measures:

- bcrypt password hashing (12 rounds)
- JWT token authentication
- httpOnly cookies to prevent XSS
- Input validation and sanitization
- Docker container isolation

### Should I expose Minepanel to the internet?

**Not recommended without additional security!** If you must:

- ✅ Use strong, unique passwords
- ✅ Set up HTTPS/SSL with reverse proxy
- ✅ Use Cloudflare Tunnel or VPN
- ✅ Enable firewall rules
- ✅ Keep Minepanel updated
- ❌ Never expose with default credentials

**Better option:** Use a VPN (WireGuard, Tailscale) for remote access.

### How do I change the default password?

1. Generate a bcrypt hash at https://bcrypt-generator.com/
2. Edit `docker-compose.yml`:
   ```yaml
   environment:
     - CLIENT_PASSWORD=$$2a$$12$$YourHashHere...
   ```
   (Note: double `$$` in docker-compose.yml)
3. Restart:
   ```bash
   docker compose restart minepanel
   ```

### Can I add multiple users?

Not yet, but multi-user support is planned! Currently, Minepanel uses a single admin account.

### Is the Docker socket access safe?

Direct Docker socket access can be risky as it provides root-level access. Minepanel is designed with minimal privileges, but for maximum security, consider using a [Docker Socket Proxy](https://github.com/Tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy).

## Server Management

### How many servers can I run?

As many as your hardware can support! Each server uses:

- **Vanilla/Paper**: 1-2GB RAM, 1 CPU core
- **Modded (light)**: 2-4GB RAM, 1-2 CPU cores
- **Modded (heavy)**: 4-8GB RAM, 2-4 CPU cores

**Example:** A server with 16GB RAM can comfortably run 4-6 Minecraft servers.

### What server types are supported?

All major types:

- Vanilla
- Paper (recommended for survival)
- Spigot
- Purpur
- Fabric
- Forge
- NeoForge
- Quilt
- Sponge

### Can I install modpacks?

Yes! Minepanel supports **CurseForge modpacks**:

1. Get the modpack URL from CurseForge
2. Paste it when creating a server
3. Minepanel downloads and installs everything automatically

### Can I upload my own mods/plugins?

Yes! Use the integrated **File Browser**:

1. Open Filebrowser (port 8080)
2. Navigate to your server folder
3. Go to `plugins/` (for plugins) or `mods/` (for mods)
4. Upload your files
5. Restart the server

### How do I change server.properties?

**Method 1 - Web Interface:**

1. Click on your server
2. Go to Settings tab
3. Edit values in the form
4. Save changes

**Method 2 - File Browser:**

1. Open Filebrowser (port 8080)
2. Navigate to your server
3. Edit `server.properties`
4. Save and restart server

### Can I migrate existing servers?

Yes! Copy your existing server files to the `servers/` directory:

```bash
servers/
└── my-old-server/
    ├── world/
    ├── server.properties
    ├── ops.json
    └── ...
```

Then create a server in Minepanel with the same name. It will detect and use the existing files.

### How do I backup my servers?

**Automatic backups:**
Configure backups in server settings (powered by itzg/docker-mc-backup).

**Manual backup:**

```bash
# Stop server first
docker compose down

# Backup
tar -czf backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz servers/

# Restart
docker compose up -d
```

### How do I restore from backup?

```bash
# Stop services
docker compose down

# Extract backup
tar -xzf backup-20241024.tar.gz

# Restart
docker compose up -d
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Ports are already in use

**Error:** `port is already allocated`

**Solution:**

1. Find what's using the port:

   ```bash
   # Linux/Mac
   sudo lsof -i :3000

   # Windows (PowerShell)
   netstat -ano | findstr :3000
   ```

2. Kill the process or use different ports:
   ```bash
   # Create .env file
   FRONTEND_PORT=3001
   BACKEND_PORT=8092
   ```

### Can't connect to Docker

**Error:** `Cannot connect to Docker daemon`

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check Docker is running
docker ps

# Add user to docker group (Linux)
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out and back in

# Restart Docker (if needed)
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

### Filebrowser password lost

**Solution:**

```bash
# Delete database to generate new password
docker compose down
rm -rf filebrowser-data/filebrowser.db
docker compose up -d

# Check logs for new password
docker compose logs filebrowser
```

### Server won't start

**Check logs:**

```bash
docker compose logs minepanel
```

**Common causes:**

- EULA not accepted (Minepanel auto-accepts)
- Insufficient memory
- Port already in use
- Corrupt world files
- Wrong server type/version

### Server keeps restarting

**Check server logs:**

1. Open Minepanel
2. Go to your server
3. View Logs tab

**Common causes:**

- Out of memory
- Incompatible mods/plugins
- Java version mismatch
- Corrupted world

### High CPU/RAM usage

**Solutions:**

- Reduce view distance in server.properties
- Lower max players
- Optimize JVM arguments
- Use Paper instead of Vanilla
- Add more RAM to server
- Remove unnecessary plugins/mods

### Minecraft server not visible in server list

**Check:**

1. Server is running (green status)
2. Port is exposed and correct (default 25565)
3. Firewall allows the port
4. Using correct IP address
5. Server is in online mode (if needed)

**Port forwarding (for external access):**

- Forward port 25565 on your router
- Use your public IP address
- Consider using a dynamic DNS service

### Changes not taking effect

**Solution:**

```bash
# Restart services
docker compose restart

# Or force recreate
docker compose up -d --force-recreate
```

1. Backup servers on old instance
2. Copy `servers/` directory to new instance
3. Restart Minepanel on new instance
4. Servers will be automatically detected

### Does it work with BungeeCord/Velocity?
