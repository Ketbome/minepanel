## Why this exists

Got tired of managing servers through SSH. Tried other panels but they were either too complex or didn't work well. Made this instead.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create docker-compose.yml file, then:
mkdir -p servers filebrowser-data
docker compose up -d
```

Go to http://localhost:3000

::: tip Default login
`admin` / `admin` (change this after first login)
:::

## Built On

- **Frontend**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + React + TypeScript
- **Backend**: [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)
- **Minecraft Servers**: [itzg/docker-minecraft-server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server)
- **Backups**: [itzg/docker-mc-backup](https://github.com/itzg/docker-mc-backup)
- **File Browser**: [Filebrowser](https://filebrowser.org/)

## What's next

Made this because I was tired of managing servers through SSH. Hope it helps you too.
